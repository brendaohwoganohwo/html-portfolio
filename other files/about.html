<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an aspiring web developer currently learning the foundations of web development through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy creating simple, well-structured web pages and exploring how websites are built and styled. This project is part of my learning journey, and I'm excited to keep growing my skills, one line of code at a time.
</p>
<p>
  As I continue to learn, my goal is to build responsive websites that not only look good but also work well across devices.
